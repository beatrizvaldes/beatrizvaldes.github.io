Do you want to know what I'm learning everyday in the Code 102 course?

Today _(first day!)_ I have learned to:

- Getting to know the syntax of Markdown, how to write and made words in **bold**, *italic*, and more!

I also learned how to use the Terminal and installed a lot of software so I can be the boss in coding!
