# hi!
Do you want to know what I'm learning everyday in the Code 102 course?

# Day 1

Today _(first day!)_ I have learned to:
- Create a new page in GitHub, which is a repository of all your websites
- Getting to know the syntax of Markdown, how to write and made words in **bold**, *italic*, and more!

I also learned how to use the Terminal and installed a lot of software so I can be the boss in coding!
One of the first dilemmas that I found was choosing a text editor. There are text editors that come with the computer and there are anothers that you have to download. All of them have a lot of funcionalities but finally the choice is ours. For now, I'm going with Visual Studio Code. Let's see what happens next!
