# Hi!
I am Beatriz. I'm from Chile and I've been living in Seattle almost for a year. Now I'm learning how to code and the first thing that I noticed is that you have to learn hoy to learn.
Here you will see everything that I'm learning.

1. Growth Mindset

 and we are going to talk about **growth mindset** 🙌🏼

A growth mindset is the most important thing when you are starting a new project or challenge. Keep in mind that **we can _always_ learn new things**. Knowledge is not static and the more you learn, the more you learn to learn 👍🏻

If I ever feel that I can't do it, I have to remember this:
- I don't know how to do this now, but I will someday
- Mistakes are good, they teach me not to do that mistake again
- Every great developer sucked in the past

So if I ever think...
>I can't do it!

Yes you can! 💪🏻
