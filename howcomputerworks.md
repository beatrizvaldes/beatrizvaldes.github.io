## How Computers Work
I really liked this videos because they showed me how computer science started, and that the same lenguage that was used in the beggining is the same we are using now. It also showed me that there are 4 basic functions that make a computer a computer:
1. **Input**
2. **Output**
3. **Storage capacity**
4. **Processor**

Everything began with binary numbers, that are basically on and off electric signals. With this binary code, we can tell to the computer everything that we want to do. All we have to do is *talk* to the computer and show it the steps. The way we talk to the computer is very important because its need to be in the lenguage that the computer can understand. If you can tell instructions to the computer in the exact same way that it can understand them, you can automatize a lot of work, and if you know how the computer processes the information you can make it do whatever we want!
