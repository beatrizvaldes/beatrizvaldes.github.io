# Structure web pages with HTML

One of the most important things in websites is **the content.** And all that content is inside the HTML. But one of the most important thing is *who is gonna visit your site and why.*
First we have to know:
- Who is the site for?
- Why people visit your website?
- What your visitors are trying to achieve?
- What information your visitors need?
- How often people will visit your site?

We have to make a **site map** so we can organize sections or pages. We can do this with pencil and paper. 

Then we have to do **wireframes**, that is just a sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. We don't have to focus on the design like colors or font, just the content!
