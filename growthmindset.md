We are going to talk about **growth mindset** 🙌🏼

A growth mindset is the most important thing when you are starting a new project or challenge. Keep in mind that **we can _always_ learn new things**. Knowledge is not static and the more you learn, the more you learn to learn 👍🏻

If I ever feel that I can't do it, I have to remember this:
- I don't know how to do this now, but I will someday
- Mistakes are good, they teach me not to do that mistake again
- Every great developer sucked in the past

So if I ever think...
>I can't do it!

Yes you can! 💪🏻
