# Welcome to my learning journal!
Do you want to know what I'm learning everyday in the Code 102 course?

## Day 1

Today _(first day!)_ I have learned to:
- Create a new page in GitHub, which is a repository of all your websites
- Getting to know the syntax of Markdown, how to write and made words in **bold**, *italic*, and more!

I also learned how to use the Terminal and installed a lot of software so I can be the boss in coding!
One of the first dilemmas that I found was choosing a text editor. There are text editors that come with the computer and there are anothers that you have to download. All of them have a lot of funcionalities but finally the choice is ours. For now, I'm going with Visual Studio Code. Let's see what happens next!

## Day 2

Today we are learning a lot about Git, but before we need to know what is **VCS**.This is Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

DVCs are the most effective tool now, because it lets different people involved in the code on a mirrored copy that in the end merges. That being said, Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because your computed fetchs for local things, and you can also work offline.

Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its launch in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.

You can personalize your Git however you want
